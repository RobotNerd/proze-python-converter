Pumpkins
by Mary Sue


"I like pumpkins a lot," Jerry said.
    "Me too," Samantha said. She smiled and looked down at the floor.
    Jerry picked up one of the large, ripe pumpkins, and he turned it over in
his hands. "I like this one. This will make a great jack-o-lantern." He looked
at Samantha. "We can carve it together, if you'd like."
    Samantha felt butterflies in her stomach. She nodded eagerly. "I'd like
that."
